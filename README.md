## How to Use: A Detailed Guide for Celestial Adventurers
Embark on your celestial journey with the Mars River script by following these meticulous steps:

### Step 1: Clone the Repository
Begin your expedition by obtaining the Mars River codebase. Utilize the versatile `git clone` command to replicate the repository onto your local machine, enabling seamless exploration and customization:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/mars-river.git
   ```

### Step 2: Navigate to the Project Directory
Navigate through the vast expanse of your filesystem to reach the newly created `mars-river` directory. This command serves as your trusty compass, guiding you to the heart of the celestial terrain analysis:
   ```bash
   cd mars-river
   ```

### Step 3: Set Up a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)
Forge a shield of isolation around your mission-critical dependencies with the power of virtual environments. Harness the arcane arts of Python to conjure a realm where conflicting packages dare not tread:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv env  # Create a virtual realm of dependencies
   source env/bin/activate  # Fortify your environment (Linux/macOS)
   .\env\Scripts\activate   # Fortify your environment (Windows)
   ```

### Step 4: Install the Required Python Packages
Equip your toolkit with the essential components needed to navigate the cosmic waters of celestial terrain analysis. Engage the `pip` command to provision your vessel with the necessary supplies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
### Troubleshooting: Navigating Cosmic Anomalies
Encountered a cosmic anomaly? Fear not! Here are some troubleshooting commands to help you navigate through the celestial seas:

- **Issue**: Virtual environment activation failed.
  - **Solution**: Ensure that you're using the correct command based on your operating system (Linux/macOS or Windows). If activation fails, try recreating the virtual environment.

- **Issue**: Dependency installation failed.
  - **Solution**: Check your internet connection and ensure that you have the necessary permissions to install Python packages. If issues persist, try using a different Python environment or upgrading pip.

- **Issue**: Script execution error.
  - **Solution**: Review the error message carefully to identify the source of the issue. Check if all required files and dependencies are in place. If necessary, consult the documentation or seek assistance from the open-source community.

### Usage: Navigating the Celestial Seas
Prepare to embark on your celestial odyssey and uncover the hidden secrets of extraterrestrial landscapes with the Mars River script:

#### 1. Prepare Celestial Image
Gather your celestial imagery and ensure it's securely stowed within the project directory. This image shall serve as the canvas upon which your hydrographic masterpiece shall be painted.

#### 2. Adjust Parameters
